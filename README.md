# Data Management Plan

Data Management Plan (DMP) of the CLARITY project, funded by the EU Horizon 2020 Programme under Grant Agreement number 730355. 

The purpose of the DMP is to provide an overview of all datasets collected and generated by the project and to define the CLARITY consortium’s data management policy that is used with regard to these datasets. 

The [first CLARITY DMP](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1491532) followed the structure of the Horizon 2020 DMP template and reported on the datasets used and produced by the project in a dedicated annex. This initial version defined also the general policy and approach to data management in CLARITY that handles data management related issues on the administrative and technical level. This included for example topics like data and meta-data collection, publication and deposition of open data, the data repository infrastructure and compliance to the Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe (OpenAIRE).

The second CLARITY DMP is implemented as a “living” DMP based on a [dedicated CKAN catalogue](https://ckan.myclimateservice.eu/) that is continuously updated throughout the course of the project. This online meta-data catalogue reflects the status of the data that is collected, processed or generated and following what methodology and standards, whether and how this data will be shared and/or made open, and how it will be curated and preserved. 

The third and final CLARITY DMP will summarises the results of the data production activities in the project that are being carried out according to the data collection concept introduced in [Task 2.2](https://github.com/orgs/clarity-h2020/projects/4) “Data requirements definition, data collection concept, demonstration and result validation concept” and the guidelines on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data management and that are described in detail in the [CLARITY CKAN catalogue](https://ckan.myclimateservice.eu/).
